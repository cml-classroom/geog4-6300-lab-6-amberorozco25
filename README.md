# Geog4/6300: Lab 6

Complete the lab assignment by filling in the template. Knit it to a Github document and then push it up to the Github repo for this assignment. When you're ready to submit, go to the "issues" tab and create a new issue. Use the subject line "Lab 6 complete" and then put "@jshannon75" and your name in the body, along with any other comments you want to share about the assignment. Your grade will be entered below:

* Question 1: Good<p>
* Question 2: Pretty well done. Legends with `tmap_arrange` are hard, but it would be nice to adjust those.<p>
* Question 3: Explained well.<p>
* Question 4: This works fairly well. You might think about adding the unit of measurement back in to get a better idea of the magnitude of these coefficients. Is -0.12282 a big number for temperature? Depends on how its being measured.<p>
* Question 5: Good<p>
* Question 6: Similar to above--could do a little more to interpret these coefficients. P value is generally not seen with the same nuance--significant/not significant is enough.<p>
* Question 7: Good<p>
* Question 8: Good<p>
* Question 9: You don't mention rainfall here, but that's the strongest variable in terms of R2 in the univariate model. Should be included?<p>
* Challenge:<p>
<p>
General feedback: I'll give this a complete, but see the notes above.
